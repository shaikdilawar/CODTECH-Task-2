## Overview of the Student Grades Tracker Project:
The Student Grades Tracker is a Java console-based application designed to help users manage and evaluate student grades effectively. It allows users to input grades for multiple subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, and determines the student's overall performance using metrics such as letter grades and GPA (Grade Point Average). The project demonstrates key programming concepts such as user input handling, validation, and basic calculations.

## Key Concepts:
Input Handling: Capturing and processing user input using the Scanner class.

Validation: Ensuring data integrity by checking input ranges.

Control Structures: Utilizing loops (for loop for grade entry) and conditionals (if-else statements for grading logic).

Array Usage: Storing grades in an array to facilitate dynamic input and calculations.

Modular Design: Organizing logic in a structured and readable manner.
